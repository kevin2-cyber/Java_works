  <h1 style="text-align: center;">The binary format</h1> 
  <p>In most cases, computer numbers are represented in the binary format. In this format, each digit of a number can be 0 or 1. For example, the decimal value 15 is 1111 in the binary format.</p> 
  <p>If you are not already familiar with the binary number system, you can learn about it here: <a href="http://www.purplemath.com/modules/numbbase.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://www.purplemath.com/modules/numbbase.htm</a>.</p> 
  <p>The Java language provides several operators for manipulating bits of integer numbers.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Bitwise operators</h2> 
  <p>There are four bitwise operators: ~<strong> (bitwise NOT, inversion, complement)</strong>, |<strong> (bitwise OR)</strong>, &amp;<strong> (bitwise AND)</strong> and ^<strong> (bitwise XOR)</strong>.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>~ is a unary operator that <strong>inverses</strong> bits in the binary format of the number making every 0 a 1 and every 1 a 0. It also changes the sign bit of the value. </li> 
   <li>| is a binary operator that performs <strong>bitwise OR</strong>: the result is that the digit is 1 if at least one operand digit is 1, otherwise, it is 0; </li> 
   <li>&amp; is a binary operator that performs <strong>bitwise AND</strong>: the result is that the digit is 1 if both operand digits are 1, otherwise, it is 0; </li> 
   <li>^ is a binary operator that performs <strong>bitwise XOR</strong>: the result is that the digit is 1 if exactly one operand is 1, otherwise, it is 0 </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The listed operators can be applied to both <strong>integer</strong> and <strong>boolean</strong> operands. If both operands are <strong>integers</strong> then bitwise operations will be performed. If both operands are <strong>booleans</strong>, they perform the corresponding logical operations (except ~).</p> 
  <p>Let's assume we have two integer numbers: 15 and 10. The first number has the binary representation 1111, the second one is 1010.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">int first = 15;  // binary format 1111
    int second = 10; // binary format 1010

    int bitwiseAnd = first &amp; second; // 1111 &amp; 1010 = 1010, the result is 10
    int bitwiseOr = first | second;  // 1111 | 1010 = ï»¿1111, the result is 15
    int bitwiseXor = first ^ second; // 1111 ^ 1010 = 0101, the result is 5</code></pre> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Bit-shift operators</h2> 
  <p>In additional to the bitwise operators, Java also provides bit-shift operators which can be used to shift bits of an integer number from one position to another.</p> 
  <p>There are three bit-shift operators:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>&lt;&lt; is a signed bit-shift operator that shifts a bit pattern to the left by the distance specified in the right operand. It fills the empty place with zeros; </li> 
   <li>&gt;&gt; is a signed bit-shift operator that shifts a bit pattern to the right by the distance specified in the right operand. It fills the empty place with values of the sign bit. </li> 
   <li>&gt;&gt;&gt; is an unsigned bit-shift operator that shifts a bit pattern to the right by the distance specified in the right operand. It is almost like &gt;&gt;, but shifted values are filled up with zeros. The result of the &gt;&gt;&gt; operator is always positive. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>See the following example:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">int val = 25;   // binary: 0001 1001, decimal: 25

    val = val &lt;&lt; 1; // binary: 0011 0010, decimal: 50
    val = val &lt;&lt; 2; // binary: 1100 1000, decimal: 200

    int anotherVal = 14;   // binary: 1110, decimal: 14
    anotherVal = anotherVal &gt;&gt; 1; // binary: 0111, decimal: 7</code></pre> 
  <p>As you can see, the result of the left-shift operator &lt;&lt; is equivalent to the multiplication by two, and the result of the right-shift operator is equivalent to the division by two.</p>
