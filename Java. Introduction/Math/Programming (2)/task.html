  <p>Many years ago when Paul went to school, he did not like the Heron's formula to calculate the area of a triangle, mainly because he considered it very complex. He decided to help all the other students in his school by writing and distributing a program, which could calculate the area of a triangle by using the lengths of its three sides.</p> 
  <p>However, there was a problem: because Paul did not like the formula, he did not memorize it. Help him finish this act of kindness and write the program, calculating the area of a triangle by the transferred length of its sides, in accordance with the Heron's formula:</p> 
  <p><span class="math-tex">\[ S=\sqrt{p(p−a)(p−b)(p−c)} \]</span></p> 
  <p>where <span class="math-tex">\( p=\dfrac{a+b+c}2 \)</span> – half-perimeter of the triangle.</p> 
  <p>On the input, the program has integers, and the output should be a real number corresponding to the area of the triangle.</p>
