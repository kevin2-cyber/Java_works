  <h1 style="text-align: center;">An overview of primitive types for integer numbers</h1> 
  <p>There are four ways to represent integer numbers in Java: <strong>byte</strong>, <strong>short</strong>, <strong>int</strong>, and <strong>long</strong>.</p> 
  <p>These types differ by their sizes and ranges:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>byte</strong>: the size is 8 bits (1 byte), the range is from -128 to 127</li> 
   <li><strong>short</strong>: the size is 16 bits (2 bytes), the range is from -32768 to 32767</li> 
   <li><strong>int</strong>: the size is 32 bits (4 bytes), the range is from <span class="math-tex">\( -2^{31} \)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\( 2^{31} - 1 \)</span> </li> 
   <li><strong>long</strong>: the size is 64 bits (8 bytes), the range is from <span class="math-tex">\( -2^{63} \)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\( 2^{63} - 1 \)</span> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The most widely used integer types are <strong>int</strong> and <strong>long</strong>. The largest one is <strong>long</strong> and smallest one is <strong>byte</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Let's declare and initialize several variables of different integer types:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">class Task {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int decimalNumber = 500; // a decimal number, it consists of digits 0-9
    int hexNumber = 0xFF; // a hexadecimal number, it consists of digits 0-9 and letters A-F
    int binaryNumber = 0b10001; // a binary number, it consists of digits 0 and 1
    int octalNumber = 0335; // an octal number, it consists of digits 0-7
    long longNumber = 33L; // L or l - is a literal for longs
    long bigNumber = 100_000_000_000L; // _ is the underscore character
  }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>If an integer value ends with the letter L or l it is the type <strong>long</strong>, otherwise it is the type <strong>int</strong>. It's recommended to use the uppercase letter L because the lowercase letter l is similar to the digit 1.</p> 
  <p>The default value for all integer types is 0 (zero):</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">int intZero; // it's equal to 0;
    long longZero; // it's equal to 0L;</code></pre> 
  <p>To know the max and min values for these types you should write the following code:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">int minInt = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // The min value of int type
    int maxInt = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // The max value of int type
    long minLong = Long.MIN_VALUE; // The min value of long type
    long maxLong = Long.MAX_VALUE; // The max value of long type</code></pre> 
  <p>Now it's time to learn about arithmetic operations for integer types.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Binary operators</h2> 
  <p>The Java programming language provides operators for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (integer) and remainder with two integer numbers (byte, short, int, long). The first three operators should be absolutely clear, but the last two may need additional explanation.</p> 
  <p>The operator / returns the integer part of division two numbers, a fractional part is discarded.</p> 
  <p>The operator % returns the remainder of two numbers. For instance 10 % 3 is 1 because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.</p> 
  <p>See the following example:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">int a = 6;
    int b = 2;
    int sum = a + b; // addition, the result is 8
    int diff = a - b; // subtraction, the result is 4
    int mult = a * b; // multiplication, the result is 12
    int intDiv = a / b; // integer division, the result is 3
    int remainder = a % b; // remainder, the result is 0</code></pre> 
  <p>All five operators can be performed for negative numbers as well.</p> 
  <p>Let's consider another example with integer division and remainder:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">int a = 15;
    Int b = 6; // a is 15, b is 6
    int intDiv = a / b; // integer division, the result is 2
    int rem = a % b; // remainder, the result is 3
    int negRem = -21 % 4; // the result is -1 because -21 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of -1</code></pre> 
  <p>Be careful with the dividing numbers by zero (0). It throws a runtime exception.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">int divResult = 5 / 0; // throws ArithmeticException
    int remResult = 5 % 0; // also throws ArithmeticException</code></pre> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Unary operators</h2> 
  <p>Also there are several unary operators: unary plus, unary minus, increment (prefix and postfix), decrement (prefix and postfix).</p> 
  <p>The unary plus indicates a positive value. It's an optional operator. The unary minus negates a value or an expression:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">int a = +4; // unary plus indicates the positive value (it's an optional operator)
    int b = -a; // unary minus negates the value 4, the result is -4
    b = -b; // negate the value again, the result is 4</code></pre> 
  <p>The increment operator adds 1 to the variable's value. The decrement operator subtracts 1 from the variable's value. Both operators exist in two forms: prefix and postfix.</p> 
  <p>The difference between prefix and postfix forms is the order of execution. In the prefix form first of all the value is changed and then it is assigned to another variable. In the postfix form at first the value is assigned to another variable and then it is changed:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">int a = 5; // a is 5
    int b = ++a; // prefix increment: b is 6, a is 6
    int c = b++; // postfix increment: c is 6, b is 7
    int d = c--; // postfix decrement: d is 6, c is 5</code></pre> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">The different forms of the assignment operator</h2> 
  <p>In Java the assignment operator ("=") has several additional forms: +=, *=, /=, %= and so one:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">int a = 2, b = 3, c = 4;
    a += b; // the same as a = a + b, the result is 5
    c *= b; // the same as c = c * b, the result is 12</code></pre> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Arithmetic and assignment operators precedence</h2> 
  <p>Operators have different priorities in expressions. These priorities define the operator's precedence (the order of execution).</p> 
  <p>Below, the studied operators are listed according to precedence order (from the highest to the lowest):</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>unary: +, -, ++, --</li> 
   <li>multiplicative: *, /, %</li> 
   <li>additive: +, -</li> 
   <li>assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /=</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>To change the order of execution, you can enclose the expression in parentheses like in mathematics:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">int a = 3 + 4 * 5; // the result is 23
    int b = (3 + 4) * 5; // the result is 35
    int c = 1 + (2 * (3 + (4 * (5 + 6)))); // 11 -&gt; 44 -&gt; 47 -&gt; 94 -&gt; 95</code></pre> 
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: All listed rules are also valid for other integer types: <strong>byte</strong>, <strong>short</strong>, <strong>long</strong>.</p>
