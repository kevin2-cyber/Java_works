  <h1 style="text-align: center;">What is Java?</h1> 
  <p><strong>Java</strong> is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation). It declares the principle <strong>"write once, run anywhere" (WORA)</strong> meaning a Java application can be executed on any platform where a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is installed.</p> 
  <p>Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years. According to the TIOBE index, it is in the first position: <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/</a>.</p> 
  <p>The applicability of the language allows developers to write large client-server web applications, modern desktop and mobile applications, useful frameworks, and libraries.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Short history</strong></h2> 
  <p>The Java language project was initiated in 1991 by James Gosling and others. In the beginning, the language was called "Oak".</p> 
  <p>Sun Microsystems released the Java 1.0 in 1995.</p> 
  <p>In 2014 Java 8 was released. This version introduced partial support for functional programming and some other updates.</p> 
  <p>To date, the latest version is Java 9. The first stable release of Java 9 was on September 21, 2017.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Some important features of Java</strong></h2> 
  <p>Let's consider several important features of Java.</p> 
  <p><strong>Platform independence</strong>: The compiler converts the source code to bytecode, and, then, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes the bytecode. Each operating system has a different JVM, but every JVM can execute the bytecode, therefore, it works on Windows, Linux, Mac OS and other platforms. So, a program that is written and compiled on one platform can run on another platform. It makes the Java platform completely independent.</p> 
  <p><strong>Simple and clear syntax</strong>: Java has syntax like C/C++ and C#. Many syntax elements of the language are readable and widely used in programming.</p> 
  <p><strong>Multi-paradigm</strong>: Java is primarily an object-oriented and imperative programming language where almost everything is an object of a class (type). We can consider a typical Java program as a set of interacting objects. The objects can represent entities from the real world or some kind of programming abstractions. When we write a program, we explain how the objects should interact with each others.</p> 
  <p>Actually, Java also supports multiple modern programming paradigms including generic programming, concurrent programming, functional programming (partially supported) and others.</p> 
  <p><strong>Garbage collector</strong>: It performs automatic memory cleaning of unused objects at runtime.</p> 
  <p><strong>Built-in multithreading</strong>: Java supports multithreading at the language and the standard library levels. It allows concurrent and parallel execution of several parts of a Java program.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Programming and running processes</strong></h2> 
  <p>You will write source code in plain-text files with a <em>.java</em> extension. The files will be compiled into <em>.class</em> files (bytecode) by the <em>javac</em> compiler. To run an application you will use the <em>java tool</em>. The tool can start a <em>.class</em> file with the main method and even whole JAR with multiple classes.</p> 
  <p>Also, it's possible to write bytecode directly but this is not considered in the topic.</p> 
  <p>The following picture shows the very simplified process of writing and running programs using Java:</p>

  <p></p> 
  <p>A Java developer writes a program in a text file with the <em>.java</em> extension. The program may include a lot of such files. Then the compiler (usually, <em>javac</em>) translates the program into a <em>.class</em> file containing the bytecode of the program. After, the JVM executes the program giving low-level commands to the computer. Here, the computer is an abstraction that may be a server, PC or even a mobile device. It includes an operating system and a hardware.</p> 
  <p>Actually, the processes are more complex than the image shows. It is important to note the following: the part before JVM is <strong>platform independent</strong>, the part after the JVM is <strong>platform dependent</strong>.</p>
