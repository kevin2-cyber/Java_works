  <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Getting started with the course </h1> 
  <p> This is an introductory course to Java. The course covers the basic concepts used to get going with the language. Each lesson may include theory, quizzes, and programming practice assignments. Read all the theory, check your understanding answering the quiz questions and practice with programming assignments. </p> 
  <p> <strong> Note: </strong> If you like learning the theory lessons on Stepik but prefer to do the coding exercises on IntelliJ IDEA - you don't need to worry about losing your course progress. All your progress is synchronized between the platforms. Follow <strong> IDE tips &amp; tricks </strong> section helping you to be more productive while learning with IntelliJ IDEA. </p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">IDE tips &amp; tricks</h2> 
  <p>When you open your course, you will see the main tool windows used to get around: Project View, Editor, Task Description.</p> 
  <h3>Project View</h3> 
  <p></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-fullsize" src="https://i.imgur.com/6wgX9Qh.png" width="400"></p>
  <p></p> 
  <p>Project View shows the course syllabus: list of lessons with lesson steps, or tasks. To navigate to a task, click on its name.</p> 
  <p><strong>Note: </strong>You can hide the Project View window by clicking on the Project tool button or with the ⌘1 shortcut. This will give you more space for code and the task description. Click the Project tool button (or invoke ⌘1) once again to show the hidden Project View.</p> 
  <h3>Task Description</h3> 
  <p></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-fullsize" src="https://i.imgur.com/vD2jxwu.png" width="400"></p>
  <p></p> 
  <p>The Task Description window gives you all the information you need to complete a task:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Learning and reading materials for theory tasks</li> 
   <li>Question and variants of the answers to the quizzes</li> 
   <li>Problem descriptions for programming assignments</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Use Task Description icons for the following actions:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-fullsize" height="20" src="https://i.imgur.com/c4WahYK.png"></p> &nbsp;– to check if a task assignment is done right for the quizzes and programming tasks (⌥⌘⏎) </li> 
   <li><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-fullsize" height="20" src="https://i.imgur.com/DIOwj3t.png"></p> &nbsp;– to run code from the editor for the theory tasks (⌥⌘⏎) </li> 
   <li><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-fullsize" height="20" src="https://i.imgur.com/vcEfyQC.png"></p> &nbsp;– to go to the previous/next task (⌘,/⌘.) </li> 
   <li><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-fullsize" height="20" src="https://i.imgur.com/H3vlDyy.png"></p> &nbsp;– to drop all the task changes and start it anew (⇧⌘X) </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Task Description needs to be visible, to hide it completely is not advised. But still, you can make it a bit less distracting by moving it out of the way.</p> 
  <p>If you work with two monitors, one of the best options is to switch the Task Description panel to the floating mode and move it to the second monitor or just place it near the main IDE window. You can do so with the help of special tool window settings icon </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-fullsize" height="20" src="https://i.imgur.com/aSQFZGc.png"></p>:

  <p></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-fullsize" src="https://i.imgur.com/A5QGkp1.png" width="400"></p>
  <p></p> 
  <p>Or if you prefer you can move the panel to the left, or to the bottom:</p> 
  <p></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-fullsize" src="https://i.imgur.com/DoSsjMa.png" width="400"></p>
  <p></p> 
  <h3> Editor </h3> 
  <p></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-fullsize" src="https://i.imgur.com/670dxIT.png" width="400"></p>
  <p></p> 
  <p> The Editor is your playground and where you will mainly be programming. You can experiment here for the theory tasks and quizzes without being checked. For programming assignments in the Editor you will find the code you need to fix, or you will write your own code from scratch. This code will be checked. </p> 
  <p> You can always run your code with the icon on the left gutter </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-fullsize" height="20" src="https://i.imgur.com/DIOwj3t.png"></p>. 
  <p></p> 
  <p> <strong> Note: </strong> If you want to easily go back to the Editor and focus on your code, the Hide All Windows command (⇧⌘F12) is the best option. Just invoke it once again to get all the windows back. </p> 
  <h3> Use keyboard shortcuts </h3> 
  <p> We encourage you to use the keyboard shortcuts, as they can significantly speed up your coding and even <a href="http://rsiinfo.org/rsi-computers/keyboard-shortcuts/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> reduce the risks of Repetitive Strain Injury</a>. IntelliJ IDEA is a keyboard-centric IDE. You can choose one of the pre-configured shortcut schemes, or a keymap, in Preferences | Keymap: </p> 
  <p></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-fullsize" src="https://i.imgur.com/k0BaxOb.png" width="400"></p>
  <p></p> 
  <p> You can always take a closer look at the list of actions and corresponding shortcuts available with the help of search: </p> 
  <p></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-fullsize" src="https://i.imgur.com/QQKLPVU.png" width="400"></p>
  <p></p> 
  <p> Or, you can search an action by shortcut: </p> 
  <p></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-fullsize" src="https://i.imgur.com/nKJFT5J.png" width="400"></p>
  <p></p> 
  <p> <br> You can also <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-keyboard-shortcuts.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> set up your own keymap</a> if you need a customizable list of shortcuts. </p> 
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Please note, that we use the default Mac OS scheme (Mac OS X 10.5+) in this course. If you use the default keymap of your OS and want a nice looking cheat sheet to print out, go to Help | Keymap Reference to get it.</p> 
  <h3> Go to the dark side </h3> 
  <p> IntelliJ IDEA initially uses the default light color scheme, but you can always switch to the dark Darcula scheme. Please go to Preferences | Appearance &amp; Behaviour | Appearance and choose Darcula as Theme under UI Options section: </p> 
  <p></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="image-fullsize" src="https://i.imgur.com/D7jBPCA.png" width="400"></p>
  <p></p> 
  <p> <strong> Note: </strong> You can use ⌃` shortcut to quickly switch between color schemes and keymaps. </p> 
  <h3> Find any action with ease </h3> 
  <p> It is very hard to remember all the shortcuts and all the actions and productivity boosters IntelliJ IDEA has. But don’t worry about that. All you need to remember is the one action that rules them all, Help | Find Action command (⇧⌘A). Just start typing the action you need, and get the list: </p>
