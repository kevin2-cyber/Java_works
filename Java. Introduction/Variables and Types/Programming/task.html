  <p>If you’ve ever been learning a foreign language, you probably know that feeling when you can't quite put your finger on the right word. Learning a new programming language sometimes feels the same.</p> 
  <p>The IDE can help you to remember the right syntaxes. Start typing any parts you remember and the code completion will give you hints even if you only have some parts of the naming right:</p>

  <p>Code refactorings can also be handy regardless of how complicated your code is. For example, use Alt + Cmd + V to extract a variable.</p> 
  <p>It is often more effective to duplicate a line of code and then edit it, than to write a new code line from scratch. Cmd + D works great for this, as you don’t need to select the whole line.</p> 
  <p>When you need to select some code fragments, shrinking the selection with Alt + Up Arrow (undo with Alt + Down Arrow) can be very helpful.</p>
